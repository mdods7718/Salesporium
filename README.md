# Salesporium
This is a .NET Core MVC Furniture Sales Application. I wanted to simulate and build a "real world like" application using .NET Core MVC. I came up with the design and ideas behind Salesporium by thinking what would a furniture store manager want in a simple application. Below this gif are some bullet features which I implemented.

- The commission percentage is automatically added for the sales employees when they make a sale
- If the employee sells an "insurance package" along with the furniture, they get an extra flat rate pay on top of their commission (this is also automatically added when the employee check marks the insurance in the form)
- All the prices get added into the Total automatically so the Manager can see the total and the breakdown
- You must sign in to the application by default before seeing any data
- The sales Mangager (admin) can edit and change all sales employees numbers
- In addition, I thought it would be interesting to add a print to pdf for the export of data - Only the manage sees this tab and is able to use it to print the pdf/data
